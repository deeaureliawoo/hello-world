Hello I'm Dee this is a lesson to study GitHub. I miss Luke today very much. What if he is the one that I missed? What if he is the one that we meant to be together? I had a vision 3 years ago that he was talking to our kids, one boy and one girl. He was talking to the baby girl, asking her:"go find your mommy" and looking at me pensively. I don't know if that is the vision of the future. I hope so. I want him dear lord. I want him to be my kids' husband in the future.
